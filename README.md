Diagnosis of Pneumonia

I.	Importance of Diagnosing Pneumonia
Pneumonia is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma, caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Its diagnosis is crucial for several reasons:
	1.	Severity and complications:
	- Pneumonia can lead to serious complications: respiratory distress, sepsis, pleural effusion, pulmonary abscess.
	- It is one of the main causes of death, particularly in vulnerable people (infants, the elderly, immunocompromised people).
	2.	Early and appropriate treatment:
	- Rapid diagnosis allows effective treatment to be instituted (antibiotics, antivirals, oxygen therapy).
	- This reduces the length of hospitalisation and prevents complications.
	3.	Differentiation from other respiratory diseases :
	- Pneumonia can be confused with other conditions such as acute bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis or pulmonary embolism.
	- Correct diagnosis avoids therapeutic errors.
II.	Diagnostic Signs and Methods
1.	Clinical diagnosis
1.1 Typical symptoms
- Fever: generally high (>38.5°C) with chills.
- Cough: initially dry, then productive (purulent or rusty sputum in pneumococcal pneumonia).
- Dyspnea: sensation of breathlessness, polypnea.
- Chest pain: often pleuritic (exacerbated by deep inspiration).
- Altered general condition: fatigue, anorexia, myalgia.
1.2 Clinical examination
- Inspection: polypnea, intercostal indrawing, cyanosis in the event of hypoxia.
- Palpation: decrease in vocal vibrations in case of alveolar condensation.
- Percussion: dullness if condensation or pleural effusion.
- Auscultation: localised crackles, reduced vesicular murmur.
2.	Paraclinical diagnosis
2.1 Imaging examinations
Medical imaging covers all the tests used to visualise the human body from various angles. These tests explore a specific part of the body using physical phenomena such as electro-magnetic fields, X-rays and ultrasound. Ultrasound uses ultrasound to obtain images of your body. X-rays and CT scans use X-rays. MRI produces magnetic fields.
•	Chest X-ray (Front and Profile):
- Systematic opacity in one lobe in the case of lobar pneumonia.
- Diffuse opacities in interstitial pneumonia (of viral origin).
- Pleural effusion may be present.
•	Chest scan (if in doubt) 
III.	Anato-radiological reminders 
Chest X-rays are the most common radiological examination used in clinical practice, and present a number of particularities compared with normal anatomy.
Aerial structures (lungs) absorb few X-rays and appear black (dark) on a chest X-ray. Bone structures absorb the most X-rays and appear white (light) on a chest X-ray. Muscles are of an intermediate tone.
•	The lungs
On the right, the lung is made up of three lobes (upper, middle and lower) separated by scissures. The small scissure separates the upper lobe from the middle lobe. The large fissure separates the middle lobe and the upper lobe from the lower lobe.
On the left, the lung is made up of two lobes: the upper lobe and the lower lobe, separated by a large fissure.
The pulmonary hili are visualised on either side of the mediastinum and are made up of divisions of the pulmonary arteries, divisions of the stem bronchi into lobar bronchi and pulmonary veins. The left hilum is often higher than the right.
•	The mediastinum
The mediastinum is the central region between the two lungs.
The right side of the mediastinum consists of a segment of the brachiocephalic venous trunk, the superior vena cava and the right atrium. The left side of the mediastinum is formed by a segment of the left subclavian artery, the right vena cava and the right atrium.
IV.	The value of imaging in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia
- In asymptomatic patients or within two days of symptom onset, chest CT has a sensitivity of around 50% for the diagnosis of COVID-19, compared with RT-PCR (2).
- Several days after the onset of symptoms, chest CT has a diagnostic sensitivity of over 90%, but a diagnostic specificity of less than 60% (3)
- The overall sensitivity of chest X-ray is around 69% for the diagnosis of COVID-19, compared with RT-PCR (4)
- For progression monitoring, only 42% of hospitalised patients have a detectable improvement on chest CT before the RT-PCR test is negative (5)
- Pulmonary embolism appears to be a relatively frequent complication, with an incidence of around 3% in hospitalised patients, and as high as 8.4 to 23.6% in intensive care settings (6). 
In practice ... 
- The initial chest CT scan, without contrast injection, is currently indicated in the presence of respiratory signs, in order to refer patients to a COVID or non-COVID unit, in anticipation of the RT-PCR results. 
- The sensitivity of CT scans for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is greater than 90%, with false negatives generally corresponding to patients who have been symptomatic for less than 3 days [HAS France 2020, Ai et al. 2020, Bernheim et al. 2020].
